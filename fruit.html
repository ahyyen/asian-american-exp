          <p>
            I remember being a litle kindergartener and being BAFFLED that
            people actually just, like, straight up bite into a whole apple?
            They don't even slice it? They even eat the skin? Who are these
            people?
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out, carefully peeling and slicing our fruit well after
            we've grown old enough to bite into a whole apple ourselves is a
            very common Asian-parent thing to do. The day an Asian parent tells
            you to go wash and prepare your own fruit is the day you know they
            truly think you've grown up.
          </p>
          <p>
            But even from that point onwards, finding a plate of 
            peeled-and-sliced apples (dipped in some salt water to prevent them
            from turning brown too fast) prepared for you is a sign of your
            Asian parent's love for their child.

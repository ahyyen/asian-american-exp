          <p>
            I remember being a litle kindergartener and being BAFFLED that
            people actually just, like, straight up bite into a whole apple?
            They don't even slice it? They even eat the skin? Who are these
            people?
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out, carefully peeling and slicing our fruit well after
            we've grown old enough to bite into a whole apple ourselves is a
            very common Asian-parent thing to do. To this day, finding a plate of 
            peeled-and-sliced apples (dipped in some salt water to prevent them
            from turning brown too fast) prepared for me by my mom or grandmother remains a 
            mundane yet beautiful reminder of their love.

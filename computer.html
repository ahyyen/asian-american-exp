            I'm sure a lot of people reading this won't be fooled; this "popular
            video game" is Genshin Impact. As a Chinese American, it really
            impacted me (pun not intended) to see an entire geographical region
            and questline in the game's world based off of Chinese history and
            culture. Everything from the architecture to the background music
            had me in a trance when I saw this region for the first time. It
            really <i>hit me in the feels,</i> as the kids say.
          </p>

            Another thing is, since Genshin Impact is originally a Chinese game, Chinese is
            one of the available game and voice-over language options. What
            better way to practice my Chinese skills than to play a game I love
            so much in Chinese, amiright?

            I think in general, a part of being Asian American is the joy of
            seeing your family's culture reflected in the media that you consume
            and enjoy.

            "If you go outside and there is wind, put on your
            jacket or else you'll get sick." This knowledge has been imparted
            onto me by my Asian family since childhood. Though a simple
            Google search proves otherwise; while <i>extreme</i> cold can cause hypothermia,
            you won't catch a cold or flu from a light autumn breeze.

            I'm not sure why it felt like my parents were always trying to overdress me. 
            Maybe it has something to do with the climate being warmer where they're from. Maybe they 
            just wanted to be prepared, to be safe rather than sorry. Or maybe it's just because
            of the myth that colds are literally caused by cold. As
            kids, my brother and I may have found the constant nagging annoying, but in the end
            it's just our parents trying their best to look out for us and keep us healthy.

            If you go outside and there's so much as a breeze, put on your
            jacket or else you'll get sick. This knowledge has been imparted
            onto us by our Asian parents since childhood. Though, a simple
            Google search proves otherwise; being cold can cause hypothermia but
            it won't directly cause a cold or flu like our parents think.

            But apparently, Asian parents overdressing their children for the
            weather is a common occurence. Maybe it has something to do with the
            climate being warmer where they're from. Or maybe it's just because
            of the myth that colds are literally caused by cold. And while, as
            kids, we may have found the constant nagging annoying, in the end
            it's just our parents trying their best to keep us healthy in their
            own way.

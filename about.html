            As a 2nd generation Taiwanese American, I’ve come to realize that
            there are many aspects of my experiences growing up that, while
            appearing strange to non-Asians, resonate deeply with my fellow
            Asian Americans. I find myself constantly joking about things like
            rice fixing everything, or making fun of American Pizza Huts for
            being so much worse than Asian Pizza Huts, or seeing something and
            saying “that’s such an Asian thing”. So this project attempts to
            share common aspects of the Asian American experience, specifically
            2nd generation Asian Americans like
            me. Sometimes the cultural differences between Asian and other more
            classically “American” households become a point of
            alienation—anything from the food we eat to seemingly mundane daily
            habits can cause us to be seen as strange by American society. With
            this project I hope to encourage both Asian Americans and non-Asian
            Americans to share in this experience and embrace the cultural
            diversity in our society.

        <div class="instructions">
          <p>
            I've always loved art. I've been drawing for as long as I can
            remember. As a toddler and even into kindergarten and first grade, I
            drew all sorts of princesses, fairies, castles, you name it. And
            often times, one of the people in each drawing would be myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see you going back to the room page to do a double take. "But both
            of the people in that drawing have blond hair and blue eyes", you
            might be thinking. "Aren't you Asian?" Yes, I am. Let me explain. I
            was born in a community that didn't have a lot of people that looked
            like me, and that's where I lived up until second grade. Everyone
            else around me had blonde hair and blue eyes, so I imagined myself
            having those features as well. I remember constantly looking in the
            mirror and being utterly convinced that there was, in fact, a ring
            of blue around the edge of my very obviously brown irises (I believe 
            this is what they now call <i>"copium"</i>).
          </p>
          <p>
            I think any Asian American who has grown up in a place where other
            fellow Asians were few and far between has experienced some form of
            internalized racism, whether they were aware of it or not (I
            certainly wasn't). The subconscious feeling of being
            different, that everything from your dark hair and dark eyes,
            to the Asian food in your packed lunches, was something to be
            ashamed of or hidden.

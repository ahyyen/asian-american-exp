            Being good at math is an Asian stereotype so common that it's
            constantly joked about among members of the Asian and Asian American
            communities. But, of course, this stereotype didn't just come from
            nothing.

            I remember coming home from school and showing my parents what I
            learned for math that day, and they would say something along the
            lines of: "Why did they teach you such a roundabout way of doing it?
            The way we learned it was like this." I remember my mom telling me
            to recite my times tables every day on the way to school in third
            grade. Even in high school, whenever I struggled with a calculus
            problem (which happened very often) I would just ask my dad for
            help.

            Maybe Asians are "better at math" because they're better at teaching it?
